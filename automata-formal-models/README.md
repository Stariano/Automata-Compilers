# Automata Formal Models

This folder captures the automata & grammar lab where I built the finite-state machine and context-free grammar using JFLAP.

## What you get here
- `CFG_01.jff` and `G1_CNF__1_.jff` are the JFLAP source files you can open with the tool to replay the automaton, convert it to CNF, or view the parse trees.
- `Docuemntation.pdf` explains the theory behind the transitions and how the grammar satisfies the lab requirements; `Introduction.pdf` is the assignment brief.
- `grammar.txt` spells out the grammar in a readable format, and `inputs.txt` collects the test strings that went through the automaton.
- Screenshots provide a visual summary for the final machine.

## How to explore
1. Open either `.jff` file in JFLAP, hit `Enter` on the expected strings from `inputs.txt`, and watch the simulation.
2. Refer to `Docuemntation.pdf` if you need context on how states or productions were chosen.
3. If you want to re-run the lab on GitHub, keep the `.jff` files and mention in your portfolio that JFLAP is required to view them.
